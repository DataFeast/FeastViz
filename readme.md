# Feast for Visualizations / Fest√≠n para Visualizaciones

One of things that we enjoy after data collection and exploration is show the information in a plot. During each [Data Exploration](https://github.com/DataFeast71/Data_explorations) we made plots to understand the distributions or see patters that could be present and showed in a simple way. However that is not enougth, we want to show something more, we want to try and make more visualizations that could be elegant, useful and attractive to keep learning more things.

## [Head of Government Annual Incomes](https://github.com/DataFeast71/FeastViz/tree/main/Presidents)

    In this case we use the [Head of Government Anual Incomes]() from previous works to make a visualization in which it showed the Presidents and Ministers from each continent. Here we add many different details using `ggplot2`.
